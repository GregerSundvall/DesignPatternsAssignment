# GamePatternsAssignment


Greger Sundvall

Not really a game but rather just a scene with a few features. 
For different reasons I ended up making a simple scene and then try to come up with features that make use of the patterns etc in the course. I'm pretty sure I understand the theory behind everything but I found it very hard to come up with real world implementations from the kinda dry descriptions/examples, so maybe I would have been better off taking an existing project and modifying it. 

Rain.cs has an object pool for raindrops.

When creating the flower sprites in Flowers.cs I instantiate a prefab without a sprite and then I assign
the same sprite to all of them. Flyweight..?

Singleton inventory.
